# Philosophy and history of Open source
You have the opportunity to become more powerful than a lot of other. So you must learn to disobey.
With great power comes great responsibility. Sotware is power.
At first, every software were free (cpst of the hardware) => Commercial VS hacker
Richard Stallman => Founder of free software movement
Free Software philosophy : 
- People should be free
- So software should be free too
- So non-free software are unethical
- Software is not the meal, it's the recipe
Free as in free speech :
- Free to use
- Free to study
- Free to modify
- Free to redistribute
Teacher point of view: free to use means that it should be usable. Something that is not user-friendly enough (for instance) is not very free to use in a certain way.
Open Source philosophy :
- Open Source is the best way to develop complex software
- It's the only way for really complex software
- The Cathedral and the Bazaar
Free Software vs Open Source : 
- Free software because it's better for humans, even if software are less good.
- Open source because it's better for software development.
- Free software won't compromise. Non-free software are to be avoided.
- Open source looks for compromises and may even help proprietary software.


# Licenses and legal aspects
The copyright : At first: the king chose who had the right to print books, in order to censor it. NB : the copyright is a censorship tool and was never designed to help the authors. It created a set of intermediaries which had plenty of power. The tool is for the intermediaries only
Code is writing :
- Copyright applies like any artistic creation
- Copyright is immediate (you only have to prove the creation time unlike patents and trademarks)
No sorftware Patents in EU :
- Abstract ideas and algorithms are, in theory, unprotectable
- Programming languages are not protectable
- UX is a graphical creation
Who's the author?
- Agreement between contributors, each is author of his/her lines
- Economic rights are usually transferred to the employer
- Authors keep their moral rights
- Diffusion under a given license is an economic right
License : "A license is a contract between the provider of the software and the user". The provider is not the author but the one who have the economic right. In many cases, that is the employer.
Each software could have its own license : 
- But standardisation helps to clarify the use
- Software distributors are not lawyers
- A license might be illegal and thus invalid (hence the test in court)
How to license a software? you have to make sure that the user was informed of the license and could read it. That's why you often have those "I agree" boxes.
See the specifics license on the slides 2 !!!!!


# Business models
Create a software : 
- Choose your license accordingly. Proprietary licenses are fine.
- Take into account the initial developement time and the maintenance, including new versions.
You need to reconsider your business model regularly
See the canvas on slide 3 !!!!!!!
The metric paradox : "Every system using a given metric as a measure of success will optimise itself to maximise that metric while becoming less and less efficient to solve the problem for which the system was initially conceived."
Ethics always come in second. It means that ethics will be considered only as long as it doesn't cost any money.
Investors expects returns on their investisments. Raising money is not a business model. What are you selling?
Open Source software is not free. Somebody else payed for it :
- Subscriptions for support/bugfixes/critical updates
- Consultancy
- Crowdfunding
- Related SaaS subscriptions
- Goodies (t-shirts, mugs,…)
- Proprietary features
- Donations
- …
Advertising : 
- But most advertising today is mainly surveillance capitalism
- Some tentative to make advertising more ethical (uTip)
Users are selling data about themselves without really understanding the value. (remember the 8 billions of google to Apple). From an ethical POV, this is rarely seen as compatible with free software ethics.
Ads are not free! : You are paying them more than what you imagine
Community driven project : 
- The project doesn't earn money
- Some contributors might be paid by external companies
- At some point, a non-profit will be needed to manage the project
- The non-profit will need money to hire dedicated employees
- See the metric paradox
Always ask the question "If I'm not paying for it, who is paying?"
Today, the challenge seems to be very similar for proprietary software
